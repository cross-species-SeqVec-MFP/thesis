To perform cross-species SeqVec-based molecular function prediction:

1) Use pre-trained SeqVec model as made available by [1] to obtain the protein-level embeddings from 
   the SeqVec model.
2) Get GO term annotations (class labels) for all proteins from the target species using 
   'GO_statistics.py'
3) Use 'split_stratify.py' to split the central model species dataset into a training, validation 
   and test set.
4) Get the overlapping GO terms between the central model organism and the target species
   for term-centric and protein-centric evaluation using 'get_GO_terms.py'.
5) Train a MLP classifier using 'neural_network2.py' on the Mouse training set. 
6) Evaluate performance of MLP classifier in target species using 'neural_network_results.py'
7) Get distributions on sequence identity using 'distru_Seq_identity.py'
8) Get BLAST top hit for every target protein using 'top_hit.py'
9) Get performance baseline BLAST method using 'get_annotations.py'
10) Identity conserved proteins functions across different species using 'GO_term_preserved.py'
11) Evaluate influence of non-evaluated GO terms using 'protein_Centric_noannotation_results.py'
