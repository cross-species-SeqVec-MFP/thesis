This repository contains example implementations in python of the executed analysis for the 
paper "The power of universal contextualised protein embeddings in cross-species protein function prediction"

Python codes for the 'characterization' and 'cross-species' parts of the paper both have their own folder.
Note that paths to directories are not accurate and complementary but should be used by the user to 
put their own paths to folders.
