To characterise the performance of SeqVec-based molecular function prediction:

To train the LR classifier:
1) The SP dataset needs to be created as described in Villegas-Morcillo et al , Bioinformatics, 2021.
Due to the large size we cannot share this dataset, but it is available upon request.


2) Split into training, validation and test set and save the seqvec embeddings (#seqs x 1024 np array), label matrix (#seqs x #terms np array), termnames (#terms list)
separately for each set. Apply per feature centering and scaling using the mean and variance calculated from the training set. For the test set, the protein length is also
required for protein_centric.py. Please save it in a list where the order matches the other matrices. Similarly, a list of test protein names is required for protein_domains.py

3) Provide the following directories
trainPath         - location of training data
modelPath         - where models will be saved
validPath         - location of validation data
testPath          - location of test data
goatoolsPath      - path to goatools installation
lengthPath        - location of test protein lengths
testProteinNames  - test protein names

4) Run main.sh with all the above as input arguments (in that order)
