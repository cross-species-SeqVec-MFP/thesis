To perform cross-species SeqVec-based molecular function prediction:

1) Download data from ??? ???

2) Install seqvec (???), psiblast, blast, goatools and DeepGOPlus (???)

3) Provide the following directories
seqvecOutputPath  - where seqvec output is saved
fastaPath         - where sequences and go annotations in tab format are saved (from uniprotKB)
embeddingsPath    - contains processed seqvec output
evidenceCodesPath - info on evidence code filtering
goTermsPath       - (created automatically) information on go terms
goatoolsPath      - where goatools are installed
dataPath          - (created automatically) data matrices for further analyses
ontology          - molecular function ('F'), biological process ('P') or cellular component ('C')
mlpPath           - (created automatically) where mlp models are trained/saved
predictionsPath   - where predictions of mlp and psiblast are stored
blastPath         - location of psiblast databases

4) run main.sh with all the above as input arguments (in that order)
